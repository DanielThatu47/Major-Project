### Welcome to StockBuddy project

### Project info

```markdown


StockBuddy is a comprehensive application that integrates a front-end built with Vite, React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS, a back-end using Node.js with Express and MongoDB for database management, and a machine learning model running on Flask for stock market prediction. These components work together seamlessly to provide a robust and interactive user experience.

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in the UI.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

### Frontend Setup (Vite)
```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone https://github.com/DanielThatu47/Major-Project.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd Major-Project

# Step 3: Navigate to the frontend directory.
cd StockMarketPrediction

# Step 4: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 5: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup (Node.js & Express.js)
```sh
# Step 1: Navigate to the backend directory.
cd Backend

# Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 3: Set up environment variables (create a .env file and add necessary variables).

# Step 4: Start the backend server.
npm start
```

### Machine Learning Model (Flask)
```sh
# Step 1: Navigate to the ML model directory.
cd Model_Backend

# Step 2: Create a virtual environment and activate it.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Run the Flask server.
flask run
```
